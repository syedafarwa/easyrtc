EasyRTC - BETA
=======

**A bundle of Open Source WebRTC joy!**

Priologic's EasyRTC beta, a bundle of Open Source WebRTC joy, incorporates an EasyRTC server install and client API, and working, HTML5 and Javascript, application source code under a BSD 2 license.


BETA NOTE
----------
This version of EasyRTC is rebuilt to be run as a node module, not as a complete application as previous versions were. There are many significant changes which should be understood before updating existing implementations.

It is hoped that remaking EasyRTC as a module, along with the event driven server architecture, will make it much easier for developers to extend and customize their WebRTC applications with an easy upgrade method.

Visit the [EasyRTC Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/easyrtc) for more information and support.

Features
--------
 * Install EasyRTC's WebRTC Server Kit on your own Linux, Windows, or Mac server in minutes not days.
 * Use our EasyRTC API and sample application code to build and deploy your WebRTC app in hours not weeks.
 * EasyRTC is completely free and open source under a BSD 2 license. No usage costs or other hidden fees.
